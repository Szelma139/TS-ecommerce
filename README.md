Creating typical website based on https://www.figma.com/community/file/892358789568947362 react+ typescript + styled-components + my own variant style of components

Website can be found here: mysite.surf.

Most stuff should be customizable.

Overall Ts convention applied by me is like this:

interface Props {} - functional component Props
interface IKey {} keys of  variant object
interface Ivariant = variant object which can apply primary/secondary etc like bootstrap does
interface SProps {} - props for styled component
